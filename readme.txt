== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why there are 2 widgets? =

Since version 6.0 the widget was migrated to a Gutenberg block. So there will be a Gutenberg block with the most modern code and compatibility and a legacy version that is 100% made in PHP to keep compatibility with older installations.

= Why this plugin is not working? =

By support experience, like 99% of problems are due to:

* There's a Javascript error caused by other plugin, and it stops any further code execution, check your browser's logs to find the problem and deactivate the conflict plugin.
* Your template doesn't have a wp_footer() function, this plugin requires this function to load JS code at the end of the website to improve speed.

= I'm using custom permalinks, How can I change the links? =

Currently, there's no function in WP API for getting link for date archives when using custom permalinks. So, you'll need to modify/hack the source code to support your custom link structure, you can do this by changing the lines where I call **get_month_link** and **get_year_link**.

= How can I exclude some categories from navigation? =

This plugin only shows the posts from included/excluded categories. It does not remove them from the navigation. If you want to do it you have to install a 3rd party plugin like *Ultimate Category Excluder* or *Simple Exclude Categories*

= How I can send you a translation? =

Send me the translated .mo file to migueluseche(a)skatox.com and indicate the language, I can read english or spanish, so please write me on these languages.

= Can I use images as bullets or trigger symbols? =

Yes, select 'Empty Space' as trigger symbol and Save, then you can add any custom background using CSS,
just play with the widget's classes: .jaw_symbol, .jaw_year, .jaw_month.

= Can I show this list inside posts? =

Yes, just add the *JS Archive List* block or add a shortcode block and write *[JsArchiveList]* anywhere inside a post
or page's contest and it will be replaced for the archive list when rendering the content. You can add the following
parameters to change its behavior:

1. **showcount** ( boolean ): select if you want to show the count post inside that month/year.
1. **showpost** ( boolean ): show post's titles under months.
1. **expand** ("none", "never", "expand"): never expand by default, current year only and always expand.
1. **month_format** ("short", "full", "number"): the format of the date.
1. **ex_sym**: the expansion symbol.
1. **con_sym**: the collapse symbol.
1. **only_sym_link**: only expand/collapse when clicking the bullet.
1. **effect** ("", "slide", "fade"): the JS effect to implement.
1. **exclude**: IDs (comma separated) of the categories to exclude.
1. **type**: ID of the type of the posts to show, this is if you're using custom type posts. By default will show posts.

So for example:

*[JsArchiveList month_format=number showpost=1 showcount=1 ex_sym=+ con_sym=- effect=slide type=page]*

Will show a widget with months as numbers, show posts under months and their count, the symbols are + and - and the effect is fadeIn. You can check source code for more information.

= How I contribute to this plugin? =

By using it, recommending it to other users, giving it 5 starts at plugin's WordPress page, suggesting features or coding new features and finally by **DONATING** using plugin's website's donate link.

= How can I add multiples instances? =

Since 2.0 you can add as many instances as you want, but there's another way to do it, just add a new Text widget only with the shortcode [JSArchiveList] then it will have a new copy of the widget.

= Can I have different instances with different configuration? =

Since 2.0 it's possible. Each instance has its own configuration. Shortcode widgets are controlled by shortcode attributes.
